## 2026-05-13 — AI context foundation

**What changed**
- Created the AI-context documentation system that future Cursor sessions
  must use to navigate the repo without scanning everything.

**Files touched**
- `docs/ai-context/CURSOR_START_HERE.md` (root anchor + routing table + standard opener + standard end-of-task block)
- `docs/ai-context/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/ai-context/DATA_MODEL.md`
- `docs/ai-context/API_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/ai-context/AUTH_AND_PERMISSIONS.md`
- `docs/ai-context/ESTIMATE_ENGINE.md` (formulas, banner rule, machine rates, channel-letter formula + multipliers, manual overrides)
- `docs/ai-context/PO_SYSTEM.md`
- `docs/ai-context/EMAIL_INGESTION.md`
- `docs/ai-context/VENDOR_PRICE_ENGINE.md`
- `docs/ai-context/UI_SYSTEM.md`
- `docs/ai-context/DEPLOYMENT.md` (real completed server setup)
- `docs/ai-context/DEPLOY_QUEUE.md` (real completed deploy queue)
- `docs/ai-context/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`
- `docs/ai-context/FILE_STRUCTURE.md`
- `docs/ai-context/KNOWN_RULES.md`
- `docs/ai-context/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
- `docs/ai-context/TESTING.md`
- `docs/ai-context/MOBILE_APP.md`
- `docs/ai-context/SECURITY_RULES.md`
- `docs/ai-context/DEBUGGING.md`
- `docs/ai-context/CHANGELOG_AI.md` (this file)
- `docs/prompts/CURSOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` (mirrors opener + end-of-task block)

**No app behavior changed.** No code, no migrations, no packages, no server
state, no deploy queue change.

**Risks**
- Low. Documentation only.
- Drift risk: numbers in `ESTIMATE_ENGINE.md` (channel-letter materials,
  multipliers) need confirmation with the shop owner before any code reads
  them. Flagged inline.
- Drift risk: schema sketch in `DATA_MODEL.md` is a target — replace with the
  real Prisma schema once it lands.

**Verification**
- All 22 files exist on disk in the listed paths.
- `CURSOR_START_HERE.md` contains: project summary, "Practicality is king,
  user-friendly is queen", read-only-relevant-docs guidance, no-whole-repo
  rule, no-unrelated-files rule, root-cause-and-plan rule, Git-first deploy
  rule, exact-`commitHash` rule, one-deploy-at-a-time rule, tenant-isolation
  rule, full task routing table.
- The exact standard opener block is present in both
  `CURSOR_START_HERE.md` and `docs/prompts/CURSOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`.
- The exact STANDARD END-OF-TASK DOC UPDATE block is present in both files.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` + `DEPLOY_QUEUE.md` reflect real values: IP `212.56.32.136`,
  Ubuntu 24.04.4, `/opt/bvisible` layout, `deploy` user, Git-first model,
  exact `commitHash` requirement, queue folders, `bvisible-deploy` and
  `bvisible-status` commands, 30-second systemd timer, SSH/HTTP/HTTPS-only
  firewall, `.env` at `/opt/bvisible/shared/env/.env`.
- `ESTIMATE_ENGINE.md` contains all formulas and machine rates from the
  brief (Materials, Machines, Shop labor, Design 150 flat, Install rate,
  raw cost, 3× sell, sqft formula, banner rule + grommets, machine rates,
  channel-letter formula and multipliers, manual overrides).
- `EMAIL_INGESTION.md` includes Google Workspace app-password setup, IMAP
  + SMTP test snippets, inbox scan loop, PO-number detection,
  `(tenantId, messageId)` duplicate guard, attachment storage path, vendor
  document parsing, review queue.
- `VENDOR_PRICE_ENGINE.md` includes cheapest-vendor logic, vendor matching
  by sender email/domain/alias, item alias support, lower-price detection,
  `VendorPrice`/`VendorPriceHistory` flow, manual-dismiss notification.
- `UI_SYSTEM.md` covers SaaS 2026 look, sidebar, sliding drawer behavior,
  cards, rounded corners, soft shadows, badges, tables with search/filter,
  empty states, no raw JSON, B Visible branding, practicality-first.
- `DEBUGGING.md` covers deploy queue, stuck lock, systemd/journal, nginx,
  Docker, build failures, healthcheck, disk/memory/CPU, email ingestion,
  tenant-scope, Prisma/DB, UI hydration, recovery posture, and the
  never-log-secrets rule.
- `CURSOR_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md` exists and shares the opener + ending blocks
  byte-for-byte with `CURSOR_START_HERE.md`.
